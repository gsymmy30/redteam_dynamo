# Design Decision: AI Pen-Testing vs. Threat Intelligence Product Strategy

**Decision Owner:** Product Leadership | **Date:** October 8, 2025 | **Framework:** SPADE + Ansoff

---

## 1. SITUATION

The AI Red Teaming Platform market reached **$1.15B in 2024** and is projected to grow at **29.6% CAGR to $9.25B by 2033**—outpacing traditional penetration testing (15.5% CAGR) and threat intelligence (14.7% CAGR).

Three forces create unprecedented urgency:

**Regulatory Deadlines:** The EU AI Act explicitly requires adversarial testing. NIS2 Directive (effective Oct 2024) impacts 300,000 European entities facing fines up to 2% of global turnover. U.S. Executive Order mandates rigorous red-team testing for federal AI systems.

**CISO Priority Shift:** AI risk became the #1 security priority for 2025, surpassing traditional concerns. **37%** of CISOs cite securing AI agents as top concern, **60%** worry about GenAI data loss, **82%** plan AI security investments, and **41%** have implemented AI red-teaming (45% planning).

**Budget Availability:** InfoSec spending grows 15.1% to **$212B in 2025**. Traditional pen-testing commands $50K-$500K+ ACVs, providing pre-approved budget categories.

---

## 2. PROBLEM

**Should DynamoAI prioritize building Product 1 (AI Pen-Testing) or Product 2 (Threat Intelligence) to establish market dominance in AI red-teaming?**

Success means: strongest product-market fit with urgent CISO needs, most defensible competitive positioning, and optimal foundation for platform expansion.

---

## 3. ALTERNATIVES

### **Product 1: AI Pen-Testing**
Customer-facing platform simulating adversarial attacks (prompt injection, jailbreaks, PII leakage) against customer's proprietary models. Delivered as CI/CD-integrated tooling + audit-ready reports mapped to NIST AI RMF and EU AI Act requirements.

**Pricing:** $5K-$50K (fixed projects), $2K-$10K/month (PTaaS), $25K-$120K+ (complex engagements), $50K-$150K+ annual enterprise contracts.

**Competition:** Robust Intelligence (Cisco), open-source tools (Garak, PyRIT) lacking enterprise support. Giants (Palo Alto, CrowdStrike, Microsoft) bundling as secondary features.

### **Product 2: Threat Intelligence**
Lab-based service where Dynamo tests common AI models in-house, publishing vulnerability databases and threat feeds via subscription.

**Pricing:** High five to six-figure ACVs (Mandiant averages $83K annually). Threat intel market: $11.55B (2025) → $22.97B (2030).

**Competition:** Dominated by giants (Recorded Future, CrowdStrike, Mandiant) with massive proprietary data. Free sources (MITRE ATLAS, AVID database).

### **Product 3: Phased Hybrid**
Launch Product 1 first to generate proprietary vulnerability data, then add Product 2 as premium offering after 12-24 months using accumulated customer insights.

---

## 4. DECIDE: Build Product 1 First

**Recommendation: Prioritize AI Pen-Testing, add Threat Intelligence in Phase 2.**

### **Multi-Framework Analysis**

#### **Framework 1: Jobs-to-be-Done Fit**

| CISO Job | Urgency | Product 1 Fit | Product 2 Fit | Winner |
|----------|---------|---------------|---------------|---------|
| Regulatory Compliance & Audit | 5/5 | Excellent (5/5) - Direct evidence of testing on specific systems required for audit trails | Good (3/5) - Strategic context but not customer-specific | **P1** |
| Pre-Release Safety Testing | 5/5 | Excellent (5/5) - Identifies vulnerabilities in unique models before deployment | Partial (2/5) - General insights not specific to customer models | **P1** |
| Continuous Validation | 4/5 | Good (3/5) - Can integrate into MLOps but needs deep integration | Excellent (5/5) - Continuous stream of new threat data | **P2** |
| Proactive Threat Awareness | 3/5 | Partial (2/5) - Limited to customer's system | Excellent (5/5) - Global landscape visibility | **P2** |
| Demonstrable Due Diligence | 5/5 | Excellent (5/5) - Tangible proof for boards/regulators | Good (3/5) - Strategic but not actionable | **P1** |

**Conclusion:** Product 1 wins on the two highest-urgency jobs (compliance + pre-release testing) driven by regulatory deadline.

#### **Framework 2: Market Dynamics**

| Dimension | Product 1 | Product 2 | Winner |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|---------|
| **Market Size** | $1.15B (2024) | $11.55B (2025) | P2 (~10x larger) |
| **Growth Rate** | 29.6% CAGR | 14.7% CAGR | **P1 (2x faster)** |
| **Maturity** | Nascent/Early Growth | Mature/Consolidating | **P1 (more white space)** |
| **Competitive Intensity** | Low-Medium (few specialists) | High (numerous established vendors) | **P1** |
| **Commoditization Risk** | Medium (open-source basics, no enterprise features) | High (free MITRE ATLAS, AVID, public research) | **P1** |

**Risk-Adjusted Opportunity:**
- **P1:** 1.15B × 1.296 growth / 2.0 risk = **745M**
- **P2:** 11.55B × 1.147 growth / 2.5 risk = **5.3B**

While P2 appears larger numerically, this doesn't account for share captureability—P2 dominated by giants with decade-long data advantages makes meaningful capture much harder for new entrants.

**Conclusion:** Product 1's faster growth, lower competitive intensity, and nascent stage favor new entrants.

#### **Framework 3: Strategic Value & Defensibility**

| Moat Type | Product 1 | Product 2 | Winner |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|---------|
| **Proprietary Data** | Strong - Every test enriches corpus of real-world exploits | Medium - Requires continuous lab investment | **P1 (revenue-generating byproduct)** |
| **Customer Integration** | Strong - Deep CI/CD/MLOps integration creates switching costs | Weak - Low switching costs | **P1** |
| **Network Effects** | Medium - Learning across engagements (with restrictions) | Strong - Shared database increases value | **P2 at scale** |
| **Brand/Reputation** | Strong - Trusted advisor positioning | Medium - One of many providers | **P1** |

**Platform Expansion Optionality:**

| Future Extension | Enabled by P1? | Enabled by P2? |
|------------------|----------------|----------------|
| Threat Intelligence | **Yes** - Vulnerability data from pen-testing fuels intelligence | No |
| Runtime Guardrails | **Yes** - Testing insights inform rules | Partial - Informs but doesn't validate |
| AI Security Platform | **Yes** - CI/CD integration as hub | Partial - Narrow feed integration |

**Composite Moat Score:** P1: 4.0/5 | P2: 3.2/5

**Conclusion:** Product 1 builds stronger moats AND enables Product 2. The reverse is not true.

#### **Framework 4: Ansoff Risk Analysis**

Both are **Product Development** strategies (new product, existing market):

**Product 1:**
- Market Risk: Low-Medium (traditional pen-testing is $1.7B market with familiar buying patterns)
- Product Risk: Medium-High (novel AI vulnerabilities require new methodologies)
- Execution Risk: Medium (proven by existing solutions)
- **Composite Risk: Medium**

**Product 2:**
- Market Risk: Low (mature $11.55B market)
- Product Risk: Medium (adapting CTI to AI threats)
- Execution Risk: High (competing with giants' decade-long advantages)
- **Composite Risk: Medium-High**

### **Integrated Weighted Scoring**

| Framework | Weight | P1 Score | P2 Score | P1 Weighted | P2 Weighted |
|-----------|--------|----------|----------|-------------|-------------|
| Jobs-to-be-Done Fit | 35% | 4.6/5 | 3.4/5 | 1.61 | 1.19 |
| Market Dynamics | 20% | 4.2/5 | 3.0/5 | 0.84 | 0.60 |
| Strategic Value | 30% | 4.5/5 | 3.2/5 | 1.35 | 0.96 |
| Risk-Adjusted Opportunity | 15% | 4.0/5 | 3.8/5 | 0.60 | 0.57 |
| **TOTAL** | **100%** | — | — | **4.40/5** | **3.32/5** |

**Gap: 1.08 points (24.5% advantage for Product 1)**

---

## 5. DECISION RATIONALE

**Why Product 1 Wins:**

**1. Regulatory Urgency Creates Unrepeatable Window**  
EU AI Act creates time-bounded demand for compliance-focused testing. CISOs need audit-ready evidence *now*—Product 1 delivers this, Product 2 provides strategic context but not proof.

**2. Data Flywheel is Asymmetric**  
Every Product 1 test enriches proprietary vulnerability corpus—this becomes Product 2's core asset. Attempting Product 2 first requires expensive lab testing to "buy" knowledge that Product 1 earns through revenue-generating customer relationships.

**3. Competitive Positioning is Superior**  
Product 1 targets underserved best-of-breed niche (between heavy platforms and basic open-source). Product 2 competes head-on with giants (Recorded Future, Mandiant) possessing massive data advantages.

**4. Platform Optionality Flows One Direction**  
Product 1 enables Product 2, runtime guardrails, and managed services. Product 2 alone provides limited expansion paths.

**Confidence Level: High (85%)**

---

## CONCLUSION

**Launch the AI Pen-Testing Product first, with Threat Intelligence as strategic 12-24 month Phase 2 addition.**

This sequential strategy:
- Captures regulatory urgency (unrepeatable Feb 2025 window)
- Builds proprietary data moat through customer engagements
- Establishes platform foundation for comprehensive AI security leadership
- De-risks threat intelligence by earning (not buying) core vulnerability data

The phased approach doesn't sacrifice threat intelligence opportunity—it strengthens it by transforming costly research expense into a data asset earned through revenue-generating relationships.

**The decision is clear: Product 1 first to own the market.**
