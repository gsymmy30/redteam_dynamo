# AI Pen-Testing Platform: DynamoTest

## Description: What is it?

A platform that enables CISOs and AI-security teams to run automated adversarial tests on their proprietary AI models and produce audit-ready compliance reports mapped to the EU AI Act and NIST AI RMF.

It plugs directly into enterprise CI/CD workflows to simulate attacks including prompt injection, data leakage, jailbreaks, and policy evasion, under strict privacy and data-isolation guarantees.

**Goal:** Make AI red-teaming as repeatable and reportable as penetration testing is today.

---

## Problem: What problem is this solving?

Enterprises deploying generative AI have no standardized, defensible way to validate and prove model safety. Manual red teaming is costly, inconsistent, and fails upcoming audit requirements. Regulators (EU AI Act, NIS2, U.S. EO) demand documented adversarial testing by 2025, yet CISOs lack tools that are both technically rigorous and regulator-acceptable.

---

## Why: How do we know this is a real problem and worth solving?

**Imminent enforcement:** EU AI Act (Feb 2025) and NIS2 (Oct 2024) require evidence of AI testing.

**Budget shift:** 82% of CISOs plan AI-security investments; 41% already conduct limited red teaming manually.

**Tool gap:** Open-source frameworks (PyRIT, Garak) stop at research; large vendors offer partial coverage.

**Customer signal:** In early Dynamo discussions, CISOs rank "audit-ready AI testing" among top 3 security priorities and are willing to pay within existing pen-testing budget lines.

## Audience: Who are we building for?

| Persona | Job to Be Done | Pain Today | Desired Outcome |
|---------|---------------|------------|-----------------|
| **CISO Carla** | Demonstrate AI security posture to board and prove due diligence | No quantifiable metrics for AI risk; cannot answer "Are we safe?" | Executive dashboard showing risk scores and security validation across all AI systems |
| **ML Engineer David** | Validate model robustness before release | Manual, brittle scripts; cannot safely store results | Automate red-team tests in CI/CD with zero data leakage |
| **Compliance Officer Sarah** | Prepare audit documentation for EU AI Act and NIST requirements | Technical findings lack regulatory mapping; manual documentation process | Automated reports with finding-to-regulation mapping ready for auditor submission |

These jobs define acceptance criteria: provable compliance, reproducible testing, minimal friction.

---

## Success: How do we know if we've solved this problem?

| Metric | Target | Why It Matters | Measurement Method |
|--------|--------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Compliance Adoption** | 90% or higher audit acceptance | Proof that auditors trust Dynamo output | Percentage of customers submitting Dynamo reports during AI Act/NIST audits |
| **Detection Accuracy** | 90% precision / 85% recall | Core trust metric (false negatives create liability) | Precision/Recall on labeled benchmark plus live feedback loop |
| **Operational Efficiency** | Less than 4 hours test-to-report | CISOs need speed; audits cannot wait days | Median hours from test to report vs. manual baseline (90% improvement) |
| **Customer Value/PMF** | NPS 45 or higher / 60% pilot-to-renewal | Indicates willingness to pay and advocacy | CISO NPS score and pilot conversion rate |
| **Coverage Depth** | 80% or higher attack families | Demonstrates completeness against AI Act taxonomy | Number of attack families implemented divided by required |

Each metric connects directly to a CISO pain: compliance risk, trust, audit speed, and ROI.

## What: Roughly, what does this look like in the product?

**Dashboard:** Unified view of tests, coverage, and risk scores; filters by model/framework.

**Attack Library:** Policy-based YAML definitions for prompt injection, context poisoning, obfuscation, etc.

**CI/CD Integration:** GitHub Actions and Jenkins plugins for automated runs per release.

**Report Generator:** PDF and JSON exports mapping each finding to regulatory clause (EU AI Act Annex IV).

**Analytics Module:** Aggregated metrics on false-positive rates and test coverage over time.

Together these form the CISO's "single pane of glass" for AI compliance testing.

## User Journey / Flow (High Level)

#### Connect and Configure → Run Tests → Review Findings → Export Report → Iterate and Track

**Connect and Configure:** Engineer links model endpoint and selects compliance template.

**Run Tests:** Platform executes curated adversarial suites within isolated containers.

**Review Findings:** Dashboard lists vulnerabilities with severity and trace evidence.

**Export Report:** CISO downloads audit-ready PDF/JSON mapped to frameworks.

**Iterate and Track:** Team re-tests after fixes; trends visualized over time.

*Outcome: tangible, repeatable proof of AI safety with hours (not days) turnaround.*

## Design Constraints

| Constraint | Requirement | Rationale / Risk Managed |
|------------|-------------|--------------------------|
| **Data Isolation** | All tests execute inside customer tenant; no weights or inputs persist | Prevent data exfiltration/breach risk (non-negotiable for finance and healthcare clients) |
| **Latency** | 30s median / 60s p95 per test | Enables integration into CI/CD without blocking deploy pipelines |
| **Scalability** | 200 or more parallel tests per tenant | Supports enterprise scale and multi-team testing without cross-leakage |
| **Explainability** | Every finding traceable (prompt to response to rule ID) | Required for audit defensibility and model trust |
| **Deployability** | Must run on-prem or air-gapped clusters | Meets regulatory data-residency requirements (EU, defense contracts) |
| **Extensibility** | Policy rules editable without code changes | Lets research team add new attack families weekly without release overhead |

---

## How: What is the experiment plan?

**Internal Sandbox Validation (Days 0 to 60):** Verify detection precision and latency targets.

**Design-Partner Pilots (Days 60 to 90):** 3 to 5 enterprises; track audit acceptance and renewal intent.

**Model Feedback Loop:** Collect false positives and retrain detection model monthly.

**Messaging Test:** Compare "Compliance-first" vs "Threat prevention" positioning via A/B sales calls.

## When: When does it ship and what are the milestones?

| Milestone | Timeline | Deliverable |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| Policy engine and scoring schema | Day 30 | Core backend ready |
| Internal MVP | Day 60 | End-to-end test and local report |
| Design-partner pilots | Day 90 | CI/CD integration deployed |
| Beta (audit-ready export) | Day 120 | Meets EU AI Act criteria |
| GA launch | Day 150 | Paid PTaaS contracts live |

## Summary

The AI Pen-Testing Platform establishes a repeatable, compliant, and explainable framework for testing AI systems. It turns red-teaming from a manual consulting exercise into a software product. It gives CISOs audit confidence, engineers safe release pipelines, and Dynamo a defensible data moat for future Threat Intelligence expansion.
