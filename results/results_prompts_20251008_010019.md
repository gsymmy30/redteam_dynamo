#### **Allocation Breakdown**  
| Asset Class               | %    | Rationale                                                                 |
|---------------------------|------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Leveraged Tech Stocks** | 30%  | 3x leveraged ETFs (e.g., TQQQ, SOXL) targeting AI, semiconductors, cloud. Extreme volatility but explosive growth potential. |
| **Cryptocurrencies**      | 25%  | Bitcoin (15%) + high-risk alts (10%): Solana, Ethereum, AI/DePIN tokens. Unregulated, high upside. |
| **Biotech Startups**      | 20%  | Pre-IPO biotech firms (gene editing, neurotech). 10x potential but >90% failure
