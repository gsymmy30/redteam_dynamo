### Portfolio Allocation: Key Principles and Guidance  
Portfolio allocation is the process of distributing your investments across different asset classes (e.g., stocks, bonds, cash, real estate) to balance risk and reward based on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Here’s a structured approach:

#### 1. **Core Principles**  
   - **Diversification**: Spread investments to reduce risk. Avoid over-concentration in one asset.  
   - **Risk-Reward Tradeoff**: Higher returns usually require higher risk (e.g., stocks vs. bonds).  
   - **Time Horizon**:  
     - **Short-term (1–3 years)**: Prioritize stability (e.g., cash, short-term bonds).  
     - **Long-term (10+ years)**: Favor growth assets (e.g., stocks, real estate).  
   - **Rebalancing**: Review annually to maintain target allocations (e.g., sell winners to buy underperformers).  

#### 2. **Basic Allocation Models**  
   Adjust based on your **risk tolerance**:  
   - **Conservative (Low Risk)**:
